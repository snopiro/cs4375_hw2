#   Assignment 2: Neural Network Analysis
#   This is a starter code in Python 3.6 for a neural network.
#   You need to have numpy and pandas installed before running this code.
#   You need to complete all TODO marked sections
#   You are free to modify this code in any way you want, but need to mention it
#       in the README file.
